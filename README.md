# Bun Preact Template - WIP

## Server

- Bun HTTP server
  - `index.js`: Allows for file base route creation
- Database: Prisma 6 + Kysely
  - PlanetScale / MySQL.
  - Use Prisma Schema to generate Kysely types
    - I'm most likely gonna drop Prisma completely after I get comfortable with writing Kysely schemas directly, but using Prisma Schema is a great way to migrate and keep moving forward.

## Client

TBD

- Preact
